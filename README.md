OneStop Gaming Shop
In the gaming community it has been well established that gamers wish to be able to expand their library of games. The biggest wall that has been hit is the none sharing of games across platforms. In our proposal we offer expansion of all gaming platforms that will boost their profits and have their compatibility under one roof for customers. 

The aim to balance all games to work on every system is the goal. Working with every console and game requirement to operate is the biggest task to tackle. We plan on bridging those gaps to bring each game to every console by having those consoles meet in the middle of their needs without lessening the play of each game.

The primary objective of this project is: To design and implement an enterprise-level inventory management and point-of-sale application.
Allow multiple users roles(Customers, Employees, Managers) with different tier access
Provide a shopping cart and inventory storage for customers
Point-of-sale system for companies, marketing abilities, detail reports, and accounting
